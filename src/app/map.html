          <p>DEMO: This room had a more developed latrine than most, with a sofisticated pit running the length of one wall. To the south of this room there is a much smaller room with several layers of foundations. This has led to the possibility of the room acting as a guardhouse for the fortified manor</p>

          <p>DEMO: Little is currently known about this room, however if you look up in the direction of the Great Hall, you can still see a first floor doorframe and the trademark stones identifying the floor level. It is also hard to ignore the large pit in this room, which is mirrored on the other side of the manor house. This pit may possibly have been a latrine however its purpose is yet to be confirmed</p>

          <p>DEMO: This room was possibly the <b> Great Hall </b> where important meetings would be held. On the floor, the bases of several supporting structures can still be seen. The high walls to the south of the room used to hold a grand window which can be seen in several drawings throughout the ages. To the east, the manor house's chapel once stood, the beginnings of the walls that used to form the chapel can still be seen. Potentially, this room may have acted as more of a secondary great room, with a currently unexcavated part of the site hosting more important guests.</p>

          <p>DEMO: As you can see, this room has a path on the floor and a pit at the end. This path does not line up with the doorway and due to the lack of keying it is believed that some of these walls were perhaps added at a different date. Oddly, the stone lining the path on either side are formed differently, adding a mystery of why the path isn't uniform. Next to this room, there is a small room leading to some stairs which would have led to the first floor. Before these stairs, there will be a small raised area on the right with a step in front that would have been used as an oven</p>

          <p>DEMO: The stone in the walls of this room don't interlock with the intersecting walls of neighbouring rooms (a style which would be known as keying). It is therefore believed that these walls may have been added at a later date and are not part of the original structure. To enforce this idea, the doorway of one of these walls does not line up with the path on the floor.</p>
