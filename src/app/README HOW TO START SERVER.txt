#### Setup by doing in terminal (with node package manager installed):
npm install
gulp

#### Start server/browser by doing:
npm start

####

Note: As the interactive map is made for a phone, it must be run in the "phone" simulator on google chrome (or whatever browser)
Otherwise clicking won't work (as clicking =/= touch).

This should start a browser tab with the website on.
However if this doesn't happen, it should be hosted on:
http://localhost:3000/map.html
So just put that into your web browser.
