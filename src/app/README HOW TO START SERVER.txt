#### Setup by doing in terminal (requires node package manager to be installed):
npm install
gulp

#### Start server/browser by doing:
npm start

####

This should start a browser tab with the website on.
However if this doesn't happen, it should be hosted on:
http://localhost:3000/map.html
So just put that into your web browser.
